                <p>Before starting, you need to know that in python, code indentation
                   is an essential part of the syntax. It is used to delimitate code 
                   blocks such as loops and function It may seem cumbersome, but it 
                  makes all python code consistent and readable.the code is incorrect:</p>
                   <code>a=1
                          b=2</code>
                <p>Since the two statements are not aligned despite being part of the
                    same block of statements (the main block).Instead, they must be 
                    indented in the same way:</p>
                   <code>a=1
                         b=2</code> 
                <p>Here is another example involving a loop and a function(def):</p>
                   <code>def example():
                            #The function starts with an indentation
                            for i in[1,2,3]: 
                               #The loop starts with an indentation as well
                               print i
                         #calling the function
                         example()</code>

               <article> 
                   <p>In order to print the <em>Hello World</em> string, use the <u>print()</u> function as follows:</p>
                   <code>>>>print("Hello world")
                         Hello world</code>
                   <p>Note that before Python 3, you could use <em>print</em> without brackets:</p>
                   <code>>>>print"Hello world"
                         Hello world</code>

             <header>Variables and Types</header>
               <article> 
                  <p>In the remaining part of this introduction, we will play with a very
                      simple example that consists in computing the surface of a circle.</p>
                  <p>First, we need to use some variables. In python, there is no need to
                     declare variables and therefore there is no need to declare type 
                     either. In Python, you hardly need to  bother about types but you 
                     may need cast from time to time. For instance, the following lines 
                     declare a constant PI and a radius. There are both manipulated as 
                     float although  we haven't mention it:</p>
                     <code>pi=3.14
                       R=1</code>
                  <p>Now, let us do the maths or using the power sign:</p>
                     <code>surface=pi*R*R
                                or
                           surface=pi*R**2</code>
                  <p>We can now print the content of the <em>surface</em> variable:</p>
                     <code>>>>print(surface)
                              3.14</code> 
                </article>
           </section>
      
           <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
              <header>Strings</header>
                 <article> 
                    <p>Of course, a more verbose message would be better but first, we need 
                       to show how to manipulate strings. In Python, they can be declared in 
                       3 differents ways:</p>
                       <code>message='The surface of the circle='
                             message="The surface of the circle="
                             message="""The surface of the circle=""" </code>
                    <p>In short, strings in double quotes work exactly the same as in single
                       quotes but allow to insert single quote character inside them. With 
                       the triple quotes(''' or """), you can specify multi-line strings.
                       Moreover, single quotes and double quotes can be used freely within 
                       the triple quotes.</p>
                    <p>It is easy to print non-homogeneous data types:</p>
                       <code>>>>print(message, surface)
                             The surface of the circle=3.14</code>
                    <p>Here, notice the , sign. If the surface Variable was a string, you 
                       could concatenate them using the + sign.</p>
                    <p>In python, strings are immutable.</p>

               <header>The Print Function</header>
                  <article>
                    <p>In order to print variables with <u>print()</u> function, as in many 
                       other languages (eg, C) you will need the special character%. Here we 
                       use only %s so every variables is casted to a string but you could use 
                       the standard symbols(eg, %E,%d,...).</p>
                       <code>print('This is a circle of radius %s'%radius)
                             print('this is a circle of radius %s and surface %s'%(radius, surface)</code>
                    <p>When using more than one argument, the print function requires to place 
                       the arguments in parentheses(this is a <em>tuple</em> as explained later).</p>

                 <article>
                    <p>There are lots of data structures in Python and sequences are of
                        particular interest. Sequences allow to put together items that can 
                       be accessed to with indexing and slicing methods. You can find mutable 
                       and immutable sequences.</p>
                    <p>Note- indices like in C starts at 0 (not 1).</p>

                    <p>Lists are mutable sequence. There are created using the square brackets.</p>
                      <code>>>>radius_list=[1,10]

                            1</code>
                    <p>When you assign a variable the value of an existing object, Python makes 
                       a reference to the existing object. consider the following example:</p>
                      <code>>>>a=[1,2,3]
                            >>>b=a
                            >>>b[0]=10
                            >>>b
                            [10,2,3]</code>
                    <p>a and b are two variables but they refer to the same object in memory.</p>

                     <p>Let us consider the following list:</p>
                       <code>a=[1,2,3,4]</code>
                     <p>that can be generated with the range() function:</p>
                       <code>a=range(0,4)</code>
                     <p>You can access to items in a sequences using an index (starting at zero):</p>
                       <code>>>>a[0]
                             1</code>
                     <p>Note also that you can count down using negative indices:</p>
                       <code>>>>a[-1]  #equivalent to a[3]
                             4</code>
                     <p>You cannot use an index out of range. a[4] or a[-4] are wrong.</p>
                     <p>Slicing can be used to access to a sub list using this syntax:</p>
                       <code> a[start:end:step]</code>
                     <p>If start is not provided, the default vale is 0. If end is not provided, the 
                        default value is the end of the squence. If step is not provided, the default 
                        value is 1.</p>
                     <p>An example would be to access the even value of a range:</p>
                       <code>>>>range(1,11)[::2]
                             [0,2,4,6,8,10]</code>

            <section class="main-section" id="Modules">
               <header>Modules</header>
                 <article>
                     <p>As soon as you want to start a project, you will need to copy your code into a 
                        file. In python, a file that contains python code is called a <strong>module</strong> and   
                        it ends with the extension .py. you may notice files ending in pyc. Just ignore 
                        them. There are compiled files created by Python.</p>
                     <p>So, a module is just a file where functions and variables are available.</p>
                     <p>Let us now come back to our toy example. As you may have noticed, the calculation
                         of the surface will not be precise since we used only 2 digits to define the
                         constant PI. Python has lots of standard module. To use a module within your 
                         own module, you need to import it:</p>
                        <code>>>>import math</code>
                     <p>It contains lots a functions and constants and in particular the PI constant:</p>
                        <code>math pi</code>
                     <p>Now, you can redo the computation and get a more precise value:</p>
                        <code>surface=math pi*R**2</code>
                     <p>Note that there are different ways to import modules or functions from a module. 
                        Instead of importing the entire math module, we could have imported only the PI 
                        value:</p>
                        <code>from math import pi</code>
                     <p>Which makes the syntax even simpler:</p>
                        <code>surface=pi*R**2</code>
                     <p>If you want to import everything from a module, you can write:</p>
                        <code>from math import*</code>
                     <p>You need to be cautions with this last statement. Indeed, you do not know what 
                        you are importing. You may have imported a function called surface that will 
                        overwrite you own variables or functions.</p>
                     <p>Note that the import statement can be placed anywhere in your code, however, 
                        there is forbidden within a class or function. It is allowed at module level
                         only.</p>

                     <p>Now, that we know a little bit of Python syntax, it is time to create a re-usable 
                        funtion to compute the circle surface:</p>
                       <code>from math import pi
                             def compute_surface(radius,pi=math.pi):

                     <p>note the column at the end of the function declaration and the block indentation. 
                        This function has one argument and one optional argument (pi). You can call it 
                        as follows:</p>
                        <code>surface1=compute_surface(1,pi=3.14)
                              surface2=compute_surface(1)</code>
                     <p>You can do much more of course (several outputs, variable number of arguments,..
                        ..) but that should be enough to start with in this page.</p>

                      <p>Python has the standard <strong>loop</strong> and <strong>if</strong> but also functional programming 
                         that are less standard (e.g., list comprehension).</p>

               <header>For loop</header>
                  <article>
                       <p>You can loop over a sequence as follows:</p>
                         <code>radius_list=[1.,10.,]
                               for radius in radius_list:
                                   surface=compute_surface(radius)</code>
                       <p>Note again the indentation that delimits the scope of the loop. Hence, 
                          there is no need for an end keyword. The indentation suffices. Note also 
                          the way to iterate through the list using the in keyword. Any object that 
                          is an iterator (such as sequences) can be used in loops like in the example 
                          above. The radius variable is created by the loop and therefore available 
                          within the loop.</p>
                       <p>There is a break statement to stop the iteration of the loop/while loop. You
                           may indeed face a situation in which you need to exit a loop when an external 
                          condition is triggered. The break statement causes the program flow to exit 
                          the body of the while loop and resume the execution of the program at the program 
                          at the next statement after the while loop. The break statement can be used to  
                          force an early exit from a loop or to implement a loop with a test to exit in 
                          the middle of the loop body.Example:</p>
                          <code>>>>S=0
                                >>>while(S<100):
                                   S+=(S+1)**2
                                   if s>100
                                      break</code>
                         <p>Another keyword related to loops is the continue keyword. It returns the 
                            control to the beginning of the while loop. Instead of continuing the current 
                            iteration and then returning control to the beginning of the loop, the 
                            continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration 
                            of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop.</p>
                         <p>There is an optional else statement executed when the loop is over,which is 
                            hardly used but it is interesting to know its existance. It is not executed 
                            once the loop is finished (either normally or after a break statement):</p>
                           <code>>>>for i in[1,2,3]:
                                      print(i)
                                    else:
                                      print("finished")
                                    1
                                    2
                                    3 
                                    finished</code>
                         <p>builtin function often used with the for loop are enumerate(), range, xrange 
                            returns a generator instead of a list, which makes it slightly faster and 
                            memory more efficient. If you want to loop over a range and print the index 
                            you could write:</p>
                            <code>count=0
                                  for x in xrange(5,10):
                                     print(x, count)
                                     count+=1</code>
                         <p>but in Python, you should use enumerate instead:</p>
                            <code>for count, x in enumerate(xrange(5,10)):
                                     print(x,count)</code>
                         <p>Finally, the while loop works exactly as the for loop. Just replace for by 
                            while.</p>

                        <p>In Python, lambda function can be used to replace a simple function. This
                           lambda function is called an anonymous function because they have no name.</p>
                        <p>To illustrate its syntax and usage, we start from the function defined 
                           earlier:</p>
                          <code>>>>from math import pi,sqrt

                        <p>An equivalent code using lambda function is:</p>
                          <code>>>>from math import pi,sqrt

                           If the input sequences do not have the same length, the list is truncated

                       <p>The filter() function is often used with the lambda function. Its usage is:</p>
                          <code>filter(function,sequence)</code>
                       <p>It returns the items of the sequence for which function(item) is true. For
                           instance the following lambda function returns True if x is even:</p>

                          playing with Python. Error messages are exceptions. In Pyhton, there are many
                          exceptions by default that can be used to catch errors. This is done using the

                       <p>Python is an object oriented language. Everything is an object (list, generator, 
                          exception....). Here is avery simple example that should help you starting with 
                          classes. Python offers most of the object-oriented tools that comes with other
                          object-oriented languages from inheritance to operator overloading.</p>

                       <p>New claass style should inherit from the object class.</p>
                         <code>class MyClass(object):
      
                                # a class variable
                                  counter=0
            
                                #The construtor
                               def __init__(self, arg1, arg2=0)
                                  self.arg1=arg1
                                  self.__arg2=arg2
      
                               def a_method(self):
                                  print('something')
      
                               def __str__(self):
                                  return('There are %s instances' %self.counter)</code>
                        <p>Here, counter is a class variable shared by all instances whereas arg1 is an instance
                           variable. You then declare instances as follows:</p>
                           <code>>>>c1=MyClass(1)
                                 >>>c2=MyClass(2, arg2=3)
                                 >>>print(c1)
                                 'There are 2 instances'
                                 >>>c2.counter
                                 2.</code>
                        <p>If you use the double underscore prefix such as __arg2, Python uses name-mangling to
                           make it a private variable. However, you can still access to it if you want, so this
                           is not a pure private data.</p>

                        <p>Here is an example of base and derived classes</p>
                          <code>class Tree(object):
             
                                   def __init__(self, name):
                                      self.name=name
      
                                   def __str__(self):
                                      return 'name:'+self.name
      
                                class FruitTree(Tree):
                            
                                   def __init__(self, name, fruit_size)
                                      super(FruitTree, self).__init__(name)
                                      self.fruit_size=fruit_size
      
                                   def __str__(self):
                                      msg=super(FruitTree, self).__str__()
                                      msg+='\nIts fruit size is:'+self.fruit_size</code>
                       <p>The inheritance is made thanks to the function super. Since functions are virtual the
                          function __str__ in the Child class replaces the one defined in the parent class.</p>

                       <p>In general, a statement ends at the end of the line. There is no request foe s special
                          character such as semi column. However, you can use it  if you want. The two following
                          lines are equivalent:</p>
                          <code>a=1
                                a=1;</code>
                       <p>Of course, there is no interest to add a semi column in such case, which explain why
                          you hardly see the semi column in Python code. However, you may want to write several
                          statements on the same line:</p>
                          <code>a=1;b=2</code>
                       <p>When a loop or if block statement is made of a single line, you may want to write it
                          that way:</p>
                          <code>if i>0:print 1./float(i)</code>
